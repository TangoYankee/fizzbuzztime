## Accessibility note
The css dimensions in the project specifications were listed in pixels. From an accessibility standpoint, [advocates](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/pixels-vs-relative-units-in-css-why-its-still-a-big-deal/) generally recommend using relative units, as they allow users to scale the website
using font settings. To make the conversion from REM to PX easier, the root font size (traditioally 16px) is scaled at 62.5%. This means the default
scale for this site is 1rem to 10px.

Additionally, the start and stop buttons were flagged by the [Wave Accessibility Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) for having low contrast. This could be
resolved by increasing the contrasting between the font and background, or increasing the default font size.
